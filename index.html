                   Before examining specific barrier types or temporality, we first analyse the overall distribution of severity scores across all reported barriers. 
                   This provides a baseline understanding of how impactful accessibility issues tend to be citywide 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barrier Types:
                    We next examine how severity varies by barrier type. By grouping barriers into categories such as missing sidewalks, curb ramp issues, surface problems, 
                    and obstructions, we can identify which types of barriers tend to pose the greatest accessibility challenges. 
                    This breakdown reveals that not all barriers are equally impactful, certain categories consistently exhibit higher severity scores, 
                    indicating that addressing these barrier types may yield outsized improvements in accessibility.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Temporary vs Permanent Barriers:
                    We also compare severity between temporary and permanent barriers. 
                    Although temporary barriers may be expected to be less impactful, our analysis shows that temporary barriers often exhibit higher average severity.
                    This may be because temporary barriers, such as construction-related obstructions, 
                    are more likely to completely block access routes or create sudden, unsafe conditions. As a result, temporality plays an important role in 
                    understanding accessibility challenges beyond simple barrier counts.

                <h2>How to calculate a 'Livability Score'?</h2>
                
                <div class="graph-container">
                    <!-- Replace with your iframe -->
                    <!-- <iframe src="your-graph-url-here"></iframe> -->

                <p>
                    To compare accessibility across neighborhoods, we define a Livability Score that captures both the quantity and impact of accessibility barriers. 
                    The score is designed so that higher values indicate more livable neighborhoods.
                    Our calculation is based on three core components:
                        - Barrier Count: the total number of reported accessibility barriers in a neighborhood
                        - Average Severity: the mean severity rating of barriers within the neighborhood
                        - Temporality: whether barriers are temporary or permanent 

                </p>
                <p>
                   First, we compute an impact score for each neighborhood by multiplying the number of barriers by the average severity:
                   Impact = Barrier Count × Average Severity
                   To improve interpretability, we then normalize the impact score onto a 0–100 scale, where 100 represents the most accessible neighborhood and 0 represents the least accessible. 
                   This normalized value is referred to as the Livability Score and forms the basis for all subsequent comparisons.

                    Top 10 Most Livable Neighborhoods:
                    Using the livability score, we identify the top 10 most livable neighborhoods in Seattle. 
                    These neighborhoods are characterized by relatively low barrier counts, lower average severity, or both.
                    The top 3 are: Westlake, Pike Market, Harbor Island. 

                    Bottom 10 Least Livable Neighborhoods:
                    The bottom 10 least livable neighborhoods are identified based on livability score. 
                    These neighborhoods tend to experience a combination of high barrier density and high average severity.
                    The bottom 3 are: GreenLake, Loyal Height, View Ridge
